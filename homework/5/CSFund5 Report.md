In this report, I write an essay of ethical implications of Deep Learning. This essay includes contents below.
- Why are people afraid of Deep Learnings?
- What are the dangers of Deep Learning? 
- What are the opportunities?

Many scientists and successful IT business persons warn the dangers of Artificial Intelligence technology especially Deep Learning. Some of them say their reasons are possibilities of superseding people labor and being a powerful weapon. However, those dangers exist in general technology. To make a bright future with Deep Learning, I think taking measuring for the dangeres and investment in researchers and facilities of introducing Deep Learning technology in our society are important.

To begin with, what is Deep Learning? Deep Learning is namely automatic learning algorithms of multi-layered neural network. Neural network is a mathematical network model consists of artificial neurons that imitate behavior of neurons in human brain. A neural network gets input and calculate the output based on its weights. It can adapt these weights from given data itself automatically. Deep Learning algorithm uses multi-layered neural network like a figure below.

Since Deep Learning has multiple layers, it can do multi-dimensional calculations with a lot of variable weight parameters so that it is possible to find solutions of non-linear complicated problems.
I think there are 2 main reasons why Deep Learning attracted much attention. First, improvement of learning speed by back propergation. Back propergation is fast method of updating weight from the error of the output. Before the arrival of back propergation, too many numerical differential calculations are needed for updating the weights. But the back propergation simplifies the differential calculations by propergating the error of the output. It dramatically fastens the speed of updating the weights, namely speed of learning. Second, many recent successful results in various applications. For example, Alpha Go developed by Deep Mind with Deep Learning system beats professional Igo game players. Moreover, in the image processing area, GoogLeNet realized image detection task in very high accuracy close to human.
Because of these excellent results, Deep Learning is considered as the cutting edge AI. However, since generally Deep Learning models have huge number of parameters and they learn random bigdata, Deep Learning is said that interpriting why the result is output is difficult. Those properties make people afraid of Deep Learnings.

For understanding how Deep Learning affects our lives, it is beneficial to refer an oppinion of a genius. Here we take up Dr. Stephen Hawking (1942-2018) who had warned the danger of AI.
Dr. Hawking is a British who made big impacts on contemporary cosmology as a theoretical physician. He has written many amazing books, including “A Brief History of Time” which became the best-seller. In the book, theoretical phisics is explanated simply for the public. Since he likes Sciense Fiction (SF), and he has excellent achievements and influence, his view about development of AI draws attention. 
On the Youtube, one of the biggest video clip sharing site, a movie of interviewing Hawking is uploaded[2]. In the video, effect on human by AI in the future is commented. He says
“I think the development of full artificial intelligence, could spell the end of the human race. Once humans developed artificial intelligence, it will take off on its own, and redesign itself at an increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biologic evolution, couldn't compete, and would be superseded.” as a negative opinion to AI.
He also gives an opinion below about danger of AI in [3].
“Unless we learn how to prepare for, and avoid, the potential risks, AI could be the worst event in the history of our civilization. It brings dangers, like powerful autonomous weapons, or new ways for the few to oppress the many. It could bring great disruption to our economy.”
On the other hand, Dr. Hawking expressed that he is not only against AI in [3].
“I am an optimist and I believe that we can create AI for the good of the world. That it can work in harmony with us. We simply need to be aware of the dangers, identify them, employ the best possible practice and management, and prepare for its consequences well in advance.”
Dr. Hawking feels thread of self-growing system of AI. And he indicates dangers of the development of full AI because it might be abused and supersede human works. On the other hand, he believes AI will be technology that brings us many profits, if we aware the dangers and take measures.

Dr. Hawking is one of people who afraid of the AI technology as he stated above. However, I think this kind of fear is not caused only in AI. For a past instance, diffusion of automobiles made impact similar to the effect that AI might give us in our society. Automobiles superseded carreages and many people have been passed away by the accidents. On the other hand, in particular in terms of dramatic reduction of transit time, they made big impacts and influenced our society. In this way, auxities and expected effects of AI are truly similar to development of technology in the history. Like many occupations are superseded by automobiles since their mobilisation capacity transcended human's and horse's, AI also has potential to supersede human occupations because it is technology.

Mark Zuckerberg, who is the founder of Facebook, that is SNS used by over 2 billions in the world, also sais
“Whenever I hear people saying AI is going to hurt people in the future, I think yeah, you know, technology can generally always be used for good and bad, and you need to be careful about how you build it and you need to be careful about what you build and how it is going to be used.” in [4].
He thinks that AI is also one of general technologies, so we have to be careful of wrong usage of AI.

However, I think the reason why automobiles in an example above could spread in our society is simplicity of finding out where the responsibilities of accidents lie. In the automobile case, when an accident is caused, it is not so difficult to judge whether the accident is caused by technological problem or human error in many cases.
On the other hand, AI is regarded as dangerous because it is hard to find out and discribe what is the problem of an accident. Many of Deep Learning algorithms predict the result from a lot of given data through their learning processes. Outputs by these algorithms are sometimes not deterministic for same imputs depend on learned data. 

Therefore, when an accident happened, for current AI technology, it is not easy to judge whether it is caused by an error by the user of AI product, developer of the AI product, or just a natural disaster.
For example, if a self-driving car caused an accident, it will be difficult to judge whether it is caused by human mistakes, wrong image processing, or something else.

To resolve these cases, many researches about interpretability of Deep Learning are proceeded. For example, there is a paper about cancer detection in images by deep learning which is interpretable, that means which parts are detected as cancer in the images.[5]

In conclusion, like automobiles are spreaded in contemporary society and have given us big benefits, to proceed with developing and introducing AI and make bright future, I believe legislation works based on deep consideration and promotion of researches regarding theoretical elucidation of operation principles of AI especially Deep Learning technology are important. And also, to provide insentives for people who work on AI technology and facilities for introducing AI products such as a new system for self-driving car on the load by investments is an important role of society to grow with AI technology.
